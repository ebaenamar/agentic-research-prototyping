```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Scope

```python
def define_scope(self, research_interest):
    """
    Define research scope precisely
    """
    scope = {
        'topic': self.extract_topic(research_interest),
        'time_period': self.determine_time_period(),
        'venues': self.select_venues(),
        'model_types': self.identify_model_types(),
        'exclusions': self.define_exclusions()
    }
    
    # Document scope
    self.log_scope(scope)
    
    return scope
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- What specific aspect of foundational models?
- What time period? (typically last 2-3 years)
- What venues? (conferences, journals, arXiv)
- What model types? (LLMs, VLMs, multimodal)
- What to exclude?

### Step 2: Systematic Search

```python
def systematic_search(self, scope):
    """
    Conduct systematic literature search
    """
    papers = []
    
    # Keyword search
    papers.extend(self.keyword_search(scope))
    
    # Venue-specific search
    papers.extend(self.venue_search(scope))
    
    # Citation tracking
    papers.extend(self.citation_tracking(papers))
    
    # Author tracking
    papers.extend(self.author_tracking(papers))
    
    # Deduplicate
    papers = self.deduplicate(papers)
    
    # Log search
    self.log_search_results(papers)
    
    return papers
```

**Search Strategies:**
1. **Keyword Search**
   - Primary keywords + secondary keywords
   - Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
   - Multiple search engines

2. **Venue Search**
   - Conference proceedings
   - Journal archives
   - arXiv categories

3. **Citation Tracking**
   - Forward citations (who cited this?)
   - Backward citations (what did they cite?)

4. **Author Tracking**
   - Key researchers in field
   - Research groups

### Step 3: Screen and Analyze

```python
def analyze_papers(self, papers):
    """
    Screen and analyze papers
    """
    # Title screening
    after_title = self.title_screening(papers)
    
    # Abstract screening
    after_abstract = self.abstract_screening(after_title)
    
    # Full paper screening
    relevant = self.full_screening(after_abstract)
    
    # Deep analysis
    analyzed = []
    for paper in relevant:
        analysis = {
            'paper': paper,
            'contribution': self.extract_contribution(paper),
            'methodology': self.analyze_methodology(paper),
            'results': self.extract_results(paper),
            'limitations': self.identify_limitations(paper),
            'quality': self.assess_quality(paper)
        }
        analyzed.append(analysis)
    
    return analyzed
```

**Screening Criteria:**
- **Include:** Directly relevant, methodologically sound, sufficient detail
- **Exclude:** Out of scope, flawed methodology, insufficient detail

**Analysis per Paper:**
- Core contribution
- Methodology used
- Key results
- Acknowledged limitations
- Quality assessment

### Step 4: Synthesize Literature

```python
def synthesize_literature(self, analyzed_papers):
    """
    Synthesize findings across papers
    """
    synthesis = {
        'themes': self.identify_themes(analyzed_papers),
        'methodologies': self.compare_methodologies(analyzed_papers),
        'consensus': self.find_consensus(analyzed_papers),
        'disagreements': self.find_disagreements(analyzed_papers),
        'limitations': self.aggregate_limitations(analyzed_papers)
    }
    
    return synthesis
```

**Organize by:**
- Research questions addressed
- Methodologies used
- Findings and consensus
- Limitations and gaps

### Step 5: Identify Gaps

```python
def identify_gaps(self, synthesis):
    """
    Identify research gaps
    """
    gaps = []
    
    # Knowledge gaps (unanswered questions)
    gaps.extend(self.find_knowledge_gaps(synthesis))
    
    # Methodological gaps (better approaches)
    gaps.extend(self.find_methodological_gaps(synthesis))
    
    # Practical gaps (real-world applications)
    gaps.extend(self.find_practical_gaps(synthesis))
    
    # Theoretical gaps (mechanisms not understood)
    gaps.extend(self.find_theoretical_gaps(synthesis))
    
    return gaps
```

**Gap Types:**
1. **Knowledge Gaps** - Questions not yet answered
2. **Methodological Gaps** - Better ways to measure/evaluate
3. **Practical Gaps** - Real-world applications not addressed
4. **Theoretical Gaps** - Mechanisms not understood

### Step 6: Validate Gaps

```python
def validate_gaps(self, gaps):
    """
    Validate that gaps are worth pursuing
    """
    validated = []
    
    for gap in gaps:
        validation = {
            'gap': gap,
            'genuine': self.check_genuine(gap),
            'significant': self.check_significant(gap),
            'feasible': self.check_feasible(gap),
            'novel': self.check_novel(gap)
        }
        
        # All criteria must pass
        if all([
            validation['genuine'],
            validation['significant'],
            validation['feasible'],
            validation['novel']
        ]):
            validated.append(validation)
        else:
            self.log_rejected_gap(gap, validation)
    
    return validated
```

**Validation Criteria:**

1. **Is it Genuine?**
   - Has no one addressed this?
   - Double-check with thorough search
   - Verify with recent preprints

2. **Is it Significant?**
   - Does it matter to the field?
   - Would answering it advance knowledge?
   - Is there demand/interest?

3. **Is it Feasible?**
   - Can it be addressed with available resources?
   - Are methods available or developable?
   - Is timeline realistic?

4. **Is it Novel?**
   - Different from existing work?
   - Not just incremental?
   - Offers new insights?

### Step 7: Formulate Research Questions

```python
def formulate_questions(self, validated_gaps):
    """
    Convert validated gaps into research questions
    """
    questions = []
    
    for gap in validated_gaps:
        question = {
            'question': self.gap_to_question(gap),
            'gap_addressed': gap['gap'],
            'significance': self.articulate_significance(gap),
            'approach': self.outline_approach(gap),
            'success_criteria': self.define_success_criteria(gap),
            'expected_contribution': self.describe_contribution(gap)
        }
        
        # Validate question quality
        if self.is_good_research_question(question):
            questions.append(question)
    
    return questions
```

**Good Research Questions are:**
- **Specific** - Clearly defined scope
- **Answerable** - Can be addressed empirically
- **Significant** - Matters to the field
- **Novel** - Not already answered
- **Feasible** - Achievable with resources

## Quality Checks

### Before Handoff to Methodology Architect

```python
def validate_output(self):
    """
    Ensure output meets quality standards
    """
    checks = {
        'comprehensive_search': self.check_search_completeness(),
        'gaps_validated': self.check_gap_validation(),
        'questions_formulated': self.check_question_quality(),
        'contribution_clear': self.check_contribution_clarity()
    }
    
    if not all(checks.values()):
        failed = [k for k, v in checks.items() if not v]
        raise ValueError(f"Quality checks failed: {failed}")
    
    return True
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Comprehensive literature search completed
- [ ] All relevant papers reviewed and synthesized
- [ ] Gaps identified and validated (genuine, significant, feasible, novel)
- [ ] Research questions formulated and validated
- [ ] Contribution statement clear and significant
- [ ] Feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Novelty verified

## Red Flags

**STOP if:**
- Gap is not genuine (already addressed)
- Gap is not significant (doesn't matter)
- Gap is not feasible (can't be addressed)
- Question is too vague (can't be answered)
- Contribution is incremental only (not novel enough)
- Literature review is incomplete (missing key work)
