## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Automatic Skill Selection

Claude automatically detects which skill to use based on your request:

```
User: "Check my methodology for circular logic"
→ Claude uses: research-methodology-validator

User: "I can't get expert annotations"
→ Claude uses: validation-without-humans-skill

User: "Help me analyze my results"
→ Claude uses: results-analysis-skill
```

### 2. Python Script Execution

The `research-methodology-validator` includes Python scripts:

- `validated_measure.py` - Enforces measure validation
- `methodology_auditor.py` - Detects circular logic

Claude can run these automatically when needed!

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a 3-level system:
1. **Metadata** (name, description) - Claude reads this first
2. **Skill.md body** - Loaded if skill is relevant
3. **Additional resources** - Loaded if needed

This keeps Claude fast and efficient.

### 4. Complete Workflow

Skills work together as a complete workflow:

```
Literature Review → Methodology Design → Validation → 
Experiments → Analysis → Review → Publication
```

Each phase has quality gates that must pass before proceeding.

## 💡 Example Usage

### Example 1: Starting New Research

```
User: I want to research whether LLMs can self-correct in real-time.
Help me find research gaps.

Claude: [Uses literature-review-skill]
I'll guide you through a systematic literature review...

1. Let's define your search scope:
   - Time period: Last 2-3 years?
   - Venues: arXiv, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL?
   - Model types: LLMs specifically?

[Continues with complete guidance]
```

### Example 2: Checking for Circular Logic

```
User: I'm building a bias detector using pattern matching.
I'll validate it by checking if it finds the patterns.
Is this circular?

Claude: [Uses research-methodology-validator]
Yes, this is circular logic! ⚠️

Your measurement method (pattern matching) is the same as 
your validation method (checking for patterns).

This means you're using the method to validate itself.

Here's why this is problematic:
1. If the patterns are wrong, validation won't catch it
2. You can't distinguish between true bias and false positives
3. Results will be artificially inflated

Recommended fix:
Use independent expert annotations as ground truth instead.

[Provides detailed alternatives]
```

### Example 3: Alternative Validation

```
User: I can't afford expert annotations. What are my options?

Claude: [Uses validation-without-humans-skill]
I understand. Here are 5 alternative validation strategies:

1. Behavioral Ground Truth (MEDIUM confidence)
   - Use actual outcomes (e.g., paper acceptance)
   - Control for confounds
   - Cost: $0, Time: 1-2 weeks

2. Comparative Validation (MEDIUM confidence)
   - Compare to established measures
   - Cost: $0, Time: 1 week

3. Crowdsourced Validation (MEDIUM confidence)
   - Many non-experts with quality control
   - Cost: $100-500, Time: 2-3 weeks

4. Hybrid Approach (MEDIUM-HIGH confidence) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
   - Small expert sample (n=30) + large behavioral
   - Cost: $500-1k, Time: 3-4 weeks

5. Multiple Strategies (MEDIUM-HIGH confidence) ⭐ BEST
   - Combine 2-3 approaches for triangulation
   - Cost: $100-1k, Time: 2-4 weeks

I recommend the Hybrid Approach because...
