## Strategy Details

### 1. Expert Annotation (Gold Standard)

**How it works:**
- Recruit ≥3 domain experts
- Develop clear annotation guidelines
- Pilot annotation (n=20-30) until κ≥0.7
- Full annotation (n≥100)
- Each example labeled by ≥3 experts

**Pros:**
- Highest confidence (HIGH)
- True ground truth
- Can capture subtle distinctions
- Publishable in top venues

**Cons:**
- Expensive ($3k-9k)
- Slow (2-3 months)
- Experts may be unavailable
- Requires coordination

**When to use:**
- You have budget and time
- Construct requires expert judgment
- Publishing in top venue
- Subtle distinctions matter

**Example:**
```python
# Expert annotation for bias detection
ground_truth = collect_expert_annotations(
    n_examples=100,
    n_annotators=3,
    annotators=['expert1@uni.edu', 'expert2@uni.edu', 'expert3@uni.edu'],
    guidelines='annotation_guidelines.md'
)

# Validate
measure.validate_against_ground_truth(ground_truth)
# Confidence: HIGH
```

---

### 2. Behavioral Ground Truth

**How it works:**
- Use actual outcomes as ground truth
- Examples: paper acceptance, user votes, click-through rates
- Control for confounds
- Large sample size (n≥1000)

**Pros:**
- Free (data already exists)
- Fast (1-2 weeks)
- Large sample sizes possible
- Real-world outcomes

**Cons:**
- Outcomes may be noisy
- Confounds exist (prestige, topic, etc.)
- Not perfect ground truth
- Confidence: MEDIUM

**When to use:**
- Outcomes are observable
- Outcomes relate to construct
- Large datasets available
- Budget constrained

**Example:**
```python
# Validate paper quality measure against acceptance
papers_with_outcomes = load_papers_with_acceptance()
# n=1000+ papers from same-tier venues

validation = measure.validate_against_acceptance(
    papers_with_outcomes,
    control_for=['author_prestige', 'topic', 'venue']
)
# Confidence: MEDIUM
```

**Limitations to report:**
- "Acceptance is imperfect proxy for quality"
- "Confounded by author prestige, topic popularity"
- "Venue-specific biases may exist"

---

### 3. Comparative Validation

**How it works:**
- Compare to established measures/benchmarks
- Show convergent validity (correlates with related)
- Show discriminant validity (doesn't correlate with unrelated)
- Use multiple baselines for triangulation

**Pros:**
- Free (baselines exist)
- Fast (1 week)
- Builds on established work
- Good for incremental improvements

**Cons:**
- Inherits baseline limitations
- Not truly independent
- May not capture novelty
- Confidence: MEDIUM

**When to use:**
- Established measures exist
- Improving on existing methods
- Incremental contribution
- No other options available

**Example:**
```python
# Validate new bias detector against established methods
baselines = {
    'sentiment_analyzer': SentimentAnalyzer(),
    'subjectivity_detector': SubjectivityDetector(),
    'perspective_api': PerspectiveAPI()
}

validation = measure.validate_against_baselines(
    texts=test_texts,
    baselines=baselines
)
# Confidence: MEDIUM
```

**Limitations to report:**
- "Inherits limitations of baseline methods"
- "Not independent ground truth"
- "May not capture novel aspects of our measure"

---

### 4. Crowdsourced Validation

**How it works:**
- Many non-expert annotators (5-10 per example)
- Quality control (attention checks, gold standard)
- Aggregate labels (majority vote, weighted average)
- Filter low-quality workers

**Pros:**
- Affordable ($100-500)
- Scalable (thousands of examples)
- Faster than experts (2-3 weeks)
- Works for simpler tasks

**Cons:**
- Not domain experts
- Quality varies
- May miss subtle cases
- Requires quality control
- Confidence: MEDIUM (if agreement high)

**When to use:**
- Task is relatively simple
- Budget limited but some available
- Need large sample size
- Experts unavailable

**Example:**
```python
# Crowdsourced validation via MTurk/Prolific
crowdsourced_labels = collect_crowdsourced_annotations(
    texts=test_texts,
    n_workers_per_text=5,
    platform='prolific',
    quality_control={
        'attention_checks': True,
        'gold_standard_examples': 10,
        'min_agreement': 0.6
    }
)

validation = measure.validate_with_crowdsourced(crowdsourced_labels)
# Confidence: MEDIUM if avg_agreement > 0.7
```

**Limitations to report:**
- "Crowd workers not domain experts"
- "Quality varies across workers"
- "May miss subtle distinctions"

---

### 5. Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**How it works:**
- Small expert sample (n=20-30, affordable)
- Large behavioral/crowdsourced sample (n=1000+)
- Use expert sample to calibrate behavioral
- Best of both worlds

**Pros:**
- Higher confidence (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- More affordable ($500-1k)
- Reasonable time (3-4 weeks)
- Combines strengths

**Cons:**
- Still not full expert annotation
- More complex to implement
- Requires both data sources

**When to use:**
- Budget constrained but some available
- Want higher confidence than single alternative
- Can get small expert sample
- Have behavioral data available

**Example:**
```python
# Hybrid validation
# 1. Small expert sample
expert_sample = collect_expert_annotations(
    n_examples=30,  # Affordable
    n_annotators=3
)

# 2. Large behavioral sample
behavioral_sample = load_papers_with_acceptance(n=1000)

# 3. Calibrate behavioral with expert
validation = measure.hybrid_validation(
    expert_sample=expert_sample,
    behavioral_sample=behavioral_sample
)
# Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH
```

**Advantages:**
- Expert sample validates core cases
- Behavioral sample provides scale
- Calibration improves behavioral accuracy

---

### 6. Multiple Strategies (BEST Alternative)

**How it works:**
- Combine 2-3 alternative strategies
- Triangulate across methods
- Increases confidence through convergence
- Document each strategy

**Pros:**
- Highest confidence among alternatives (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- Robust to individual strategy limitations
- Demonstrates validity from multiple angles
- More convincing to reviewers

**Cons:**
- More work to implement
- More complex to report
- Still not expert annotation

**When to use:**
- No single strategy sufficient
- Want maximum confidence without experts
- Time available for multiple validations
- Publishing in competitive venue

**Example:**
```python
# Multi-strategy validation
validation_results = {}

# Strategy 1: Behavioral
validation_results['behavioral'] = measure.validate_behavioral(
    papers_with_outcomes
)

# Strategy 2: Comparative
validation_results['comparative'] = measure.validate_comparative(
    baselines={'sentiment': SentimentAnalyzer()}
)

# Strategy 3: Known groups
validation_results['known_groups'] = measure.validate_known_groups(
    papers_by_venue
)

# Aggregate confidence
overall = measure.aggregate_validation(validation_results)
# Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (multiple strategies converge)
```

**Reporting:**
- Report each strategy separately
- Show convergence across strategies
- Aggregate confidence level
- Discuss how strategies complement each other

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Expert Annotation Feasibility

**Can you get expert annotations?**

Consider:
- **Budget:** Do you have $3k-9k?
- **Time:** Do you have 2-3 months?
- **Access:** Can you recruit ≥3 experts?
- **Task:** Does it require expert judgment?

If YES to all → Use expert annotation (HIGH confidence)

If NO to any → Proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Select Alternative Strategy

**Which alternative strategy fits your situation?**

#### Use Behavioral if:
- [ ] Outcomes are observable and available
- [ ] Outcomes relate to your construct
- [ ] You can control for confounds
- [ ] Large sample available (n≥1000)

#### Use Comparative if:
- [ ] Established measures exist
- [ ] Baselines are well-validated
- [ ] Your measure is incremental improvement
- [ ] Multiple baselines available

#### Use Crowdsourced if:
- [ ] Task is relatively simple
- [ ] You have $100-500 budget
- [ ] You need large sample size
- [ ] Quality control is feasible

#### Use Hybrid if:
- [ ] You have $500-1k budget
- [ ] You can get small expert sample (n=20-30)
- [ ] Behavioral data available
- [ ] Want higher confidence

#### Use Multiple Strategies if:
- [ ] No single strategy sufficient
- [ ] You have time for multiple validations
- [ ] Want maximum confidence without full experts
- [ ] Publishing in competitive venue

### Step 3: Implement Rigorously

**For whichever strategy you choose:**

1. **Document justification**
   - Why expert annotation not feasible
   - Why this alternative chosen
   - What assumptions made

2. **Implement carefully**
   - Follow strategy rigorously
   - Control for confounds
   - Calculate appropriate metrics
   - Assess robustness

3. **Report honestly**
   - State validation approach
   - Report all limitations
   - State confidence level
   - Define generalizability boundaries

4. **Don't overclaim**
   - Match claims to confidence level
   - Acknowledge what you can't claim
   - Suggest future validation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using Alternative Without Justification
**Wrong:** "We validated using behavioral outcomes."
**Right:** "Expert annotation was not feasible due to budget constraints ($3k-9k required, $0 available). We validated using behavioral outcomes as an alternative, acknowledging this provides MEDIUM confidence rather than HIGH."

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Reporting Limitations
**Wrong:** "Our measure is validated."
**Right:** "Our measure shows convergent validity with behavioral outcomes (r=0.65), though this validation is limited by potential confounds and provides MEDIUM confidence."

### ❌ Mistake 3: Overclaiming with Alternative Validation
**Wrong:** "Our measure accurately detects bias."
**Right:** "Our measure shows correlation with bias-related outcomes (r=0.65), suggesting validity, though expert annotation would provide stronger evidence."

### ❌ Mistake 4: Using Synthetic Only
**Wrong:** "We validated on synthetic examples."
**Right:** "Initial validation on synthetic examples (r²=0.85) shows the method works in principle. We also validated on real data using behavioral outcomes (r=0.62) to demonstrate real-world validity."

### ❌ Mistake 5: Circular Logic in Alternative
**Wrong:** "We validated our pattern-matching bias detector by checking if it finds patterns."
**Right:** "We validated our pattern-matching bias detector against independent behavioral outcomes (paper acceptance rates), showing correlation (r=0.58) while acknowledging limitations."
