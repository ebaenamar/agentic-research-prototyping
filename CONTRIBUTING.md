# Contributing to Agentic Research Prototyping

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to provide a rigorous, reproducible workflow for research in foundational AI models.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues

If you find bugs, methodological issues, or have suggestions:

- Open a GitHub issue
- Describe the problem clearly
- Provide examples if possible
- Suggest potential solutions

### 2. Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples
- Improve clarity
- Add diagrams or visualizations

### 3. Add Validation Strategies

If you have experience with alternative validation approaches:

- Document the strategy clearly
- Provide implementation examples
- Discuss limitations honestly
- Include confidence level assessment

### 4. Contribute Examples

Real-world examples help others:

- Complete research workflows
- Specific validation implementations
- Case studies
- Lessons learned

### 5. Improve Detection Algorithms

Help improve automated detection:

- Circular logic detection
- Overclaiming detection
- Statistical validity checks
- Reproducibility verification

## Guidelines

### Methodological Rigor

All contributions must maintain the core principles:

1. **No Circular Logic** - Validation must be independent
2. **Mandatory Validation** - All measures must be validated
3. **Pre-specified Analysis** - Prevent p-hacking
4. **Honest Reporting** - Report all results, acknowledge limitations

### Code Quality

If contributing code:

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Include docstrings
- Add type hints
- Write tests
- Document assumptions

### Documentation Quality

If contributing documentation:

- Be clear and concise
- Use examples
- Be honest about limitations
- Cite sources when appropriate
